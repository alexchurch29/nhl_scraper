Used to scrape and parse html/json files provided by the NHL for all games in a given date range. Returns pandas dataframes with schedule, game rosters, shift data, pbp event data, coaches, and officials. 

The code borrows heavily from the NHL Scraper repository created by Harry Shomer (https://github.com/HarryShomer/Hockey-Scraper), with additional credit going to Muneeb Alam (https://github.com/muneebalam).  

The scraper should currently function properly for all games from the 2009 season onward. Looking to add 2007/08 compatibility down the road.
